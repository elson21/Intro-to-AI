"""
5-tile puzzle with BFS and IDS

This code solves a puzzle of a 5-tile board and a blank.
At each step, one of the tiles can be moved into the blank space.
The problem starts at a given initial configuration and the objective is to find a sequence
of moves so that the tiles are in the goal configuration.

Both the initial state and goal configuration are provided by user input as
*initial configuration = initial_state
*goal configuration = goal_state

There are 4 possible actions:
*Up = U
*Down = D
*Left = L
*Right = R
