# Practice Assignment

## 1. Palindrome
Write a Python program to check if a given positive integer is a palindrome or not.  
For example, 13531, 5555, 2442, 7290927 are palindromes, while 12531, 1234, 94783 are non-palindromes.  
You are only allowed to use math operations without converting the integer into a string.  

## 2. Pyramid
Write a Python program that takes as input a positive integer N and prints the integers between 1 and N (inclusive) with one integer on line 1, 2 integers on line 2 and so on. A example with N=15 is shown below.

1  
2 3  
4 5 6  
7 8 9 10  
11 12 13 14 15  

## 3. Reverse string
Write a Python program to reverse a string given as input.

## 4. Get frequency
Write a Python program that counts the frequencies of different characters in a string given as input and prints the character(s) with the minimum frequency. One of the ways to solve this is to use a dictionary.

## 5. Infix to Postfix
Write a program in Python that takes a mathematical expression given as a string in infix format and outputs the expression in postfix format.

## 6. Split String to Substrings
Write a Python program to split a string based on a special character, like a comma, into substrings. Each substring is stored as elements in a list.  
The program outputs the list.  
For example: ‘Oats, and, beans, and, barley grow, do you, or, I, or anyone know?’ is output as [‘Oats’, ‘and’, ‘beans’, ‘and’, ‘barley grow’, ‘do you’, ‘or’, ‘I’, ‘or anyone know?’]

## 7. Concatenating Lines from Multiple Files
Write a Python program that opens two given txt files in read mode and combines each line from the first file with the corresponding line in the second file. It writes each combined line to another output file.  
**Example:**

*file1.txt*
```
Hello  
This is  
Who  
```
*file2.txt*
```
world!
computer
are you?
```
*output.txt*
```
Hello world!
This is computer
Who are you?
```


## 8. Word Count
Write a Python program that takes a text file as input and returns the number of words in it.  
A word is defined as a sequence of characters separated by the following separators:

1. One of or more blank spaces, 
2. One or more new lines, 
3. A comma, period, or semicolon followed by a blank space,
4. A hyphen that is preceded and followed by a blank space.
